in rust, variable is unmutable in default, it is not allowed to be changed while executing.
if you want to change its value, you should change its value by let keyword on purpose.

if you want to have a mutable variable, you could use a mut keyword, such as:
let mut a = 123;
a = 456;

if you want to have a constant, you can do this:
const A: i32 = 234;

RUST supports following integer types:
8-bit 	i8 for signed	u8 for unsigned
16-bit	i16 for signed	u16 for unsigned
32-bit	i32 for signed	u32 for unsigned
64-bit	i64 for signed	u64 for unsigned
128-bit i128 for signed	u128 for unsigned
arch	isize for signed	usize for unsigned
